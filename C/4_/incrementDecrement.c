/*
  ++ and -- operator as prefix and postfix:-


    If you use the ++ operator as a prefix like:
      <++var>, the value of var is Incremented by 1;
    then it returns the value.

    If you use the ++ operator as a postfix like:
      <var++>, the original value of var is returned first;
    then var is "Incremented by 1".

  The -- operator works in a similar way to the ++ operator except -- decreases the value by 1.

  • Pre-Increment Operator
  • Post-Increment Operator

  ➤ Pre-increment operator: A pre-increment operator is used to increment the value of a variable before using it in an expression. In the Pre-Increment, value is first incremented and then used inside the expression.
  a = ++10;

  ➤ Post-increment operator: A post-increment operator is used to increment the value of the variable after executing the expression completely in which post-increment is used. In the Post-Increment, value is first used in an expression and then incremented.
  a = 10++;
