  Unlike <for> and <while> loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in C programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

  Do...While :- A <do...while> loop is similar to a <while> loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to "Execute at least one time".
